Both Mr Khan and ex-foreign minister Mr Qureshi had been handed10 years’ rigorous punishmenteach for, in the eyes of the presiding judge, ‘leaking’ asecret cableand thereby compromising the safety, integrity and credibility of Pakistan’s secure communication system with its diplomatic missions abroad.\\nThe conviction hadprecludedMr Qureshi’s right to participate in the general election; Mr Khan had already been deemed ineligible by an earlier conviction in theToshakhana case.\\nThe verdict had been secured on the state’s third attempt at prosecuting the case. Two earlier trials wereaborted by the IHCafter it found serious irregularities in the proceedings. Even then, the trial court’s sentence was almost immediatelyslammed by the legal community; many had criticised the abnormal circumstances in which the trial was completed. This was the same case, it may be recalled, in which the court had denied the two defendants their right to appoint their own counsels or cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, even though the prosecution had sought the maximum penalty of adeath sentence.\\nEven then, the biggest charge the two were found guilty of — compromising the country’s secure diplomatic communication system — was undermined by the Foreign Office shortly after, when itaffirmedthrough a statement that its communication system had been audited and found to be safe and protected. There was, therefore, near unanimity in the legal community that the verdict would be overturned: it was not a question of if but when.\\n\\nIn retrospect, Mr Khan and Mr Qureshi committed a historical blunder and caused an international diplomatic incident by using the cipher as apolitical prop; however, this was never reason enough to punish them under laws originally meant to prosecute traitors and foreign spies. That, as prime minister, Mr Khan chose to use sensitive diplomatic communications for selfish political reasons,imperilling diplomatic tieswith the country’s largest trading partner, should have been left as something for voters to ponder.\\nInstead, our state, in its desperation to victimise another ex-prime minister, once again left them looking like more of a hero than they perhaps deserved to be. There are lessons aplenty in this saga: but will our state ever learn?\\nPublished in Dawn, June 4th, 2024', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1837680/cipher-acquittal'}, {'title': 'China sojourn', 'content': 'AS the prime minister begins his five-day visit to China today, investment — particularly to reinvigorate the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor — will top the agenda. Shehbaz Sharif is due to meet the top tier of the Chinese leadership, including President Xi Jinping, and will visit various regions as Pakistan seeks to attract substantial Chinese investment. Of course, how many of these pledges materialise into much-needed dollars flowing into Pakistan, and the attendant infrastructure and jobs, remains to be seen. For the moment, the mood on both sides seems positive, and the challenges standing in the way of realising CPEC’s second phase can be overcome if both capitals deal with these proactively.\\nEnvisaged over a decade ago, CPEC has been touted as a ‘game changer’ by the state, while critics have termed it a ‘debt trap’. A more dispassionate analysis suggests that the multibillion-dollar scheme has been beneficial to Pakistan, bringing online a number of power projects, as well as expanding the road network. Yet many promises remain unfulfilled; for example, the special economic zones have yet to open for business, while Pakistan is saddled with billions in Chinese debt. Therefore, Prime Minister Sharif’s visit presents an opportunity to address these challenges. With regard to Beijing’s concerns, the safety of its workers in Pakistan will naturally be near the top of the agenda. The March terrorist attack in Dasu in which five Chinese nationals were killed exemplifies the security challenges Pakistan will have to overcome if it seeks to attract more qualified Chinese manpower and funds to take the next phase of CPEC forward. Unless the scourge of terrorism is neutralised, other foreign investors, too, will be wary about bringing their money and people to Pakistan. Moreover, some media reports point to Chinese concerns regarding bureaucratic bottlenecks and political instability that stand in the way of smooth project operations. Perhaps this is the raison d’être of the SIFC — to assure investors of continuity in policies. Pakistan should also be mentally prepared to deal with the geopolitical blowback of expanding CPEC, particularly ‘feedback’ from Western capitals unhappy about deepening Sino-Pakistan ties. It is difficult but possible to maintain an equilibrium between the West and China. Also, the benefits of new projects should flow to underdeveloped communities, specifically in Balochistan and KP, to ensure that growth is equitable.\\nPublished in Dawn, June 4th, 2024', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1837679/china-sojourn'}, {'title': 'Measles resurgence', 'content': 'THE alarming rise in measles cases across Pakistan signals a burgeoning public health crisis that demands immediate intervention. Latest reports show the disease wreaking havoc in cities in Punjab. With around 3,400 cases since January this year, the situation in the province is dire. Several fatalities have already been reported, with some pending confirmation. This trend is echoed nationwide, including in Sindh and KP, though the more significant outbreaks have been reported from south Punjab. Measles, a highly contagious viral disease, poses severe risks to children, especially those who are malnourished or unvaccinated. Complications include pneumonia, encephalitis, severe diarrhoea, dehydration, and blindness. The recent spike in cases among infants younger than nine months is particularly of concern, as the standard vaccination schedule starts after this age.\\nSo what has led to such a spike? A key driver is low vaccination rates, which the WHO has consistently warned the world about. The Covid pandemic disrupted routine immunisation services worldwide, leading to a significant drop in vaccination coverage. Misinformation and the global ‘anti-vax’ movement added fuel to the fire. The result is a backlog of children around the world who are at high risk. In Pakistan, malnutrition has exacerbated the severity of measles and its complications. To address this escalating emergency, the government must intensify vaccination campaigns. It is encouraging that during the upcoming anti-polio campaign, the government plans to simultaneously check for measles cases and administer measles shots to children in some areas. This must be extended to all cities. Alongside, public health education campaigns are crucial to raise awareness about the importance of the jab and early intervention. Improving access to healthcare services in underserved areas and addressing the nutritional needs of children is equally vital. Of particular importance is accountability among health officials to prevent negligence. The government must act swiftly.\\nPublished in Dawn, June 4th, 2024', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1837678/measles-resurgence'}, {'title': 'Lower inflation', 'content': 'AS anticipated, the dramatic drop in May’s inflation figures to 11.8pc — the lowest in 30 months — has provided enough ammunition to critics of the State Bank’s tight monetary policy stance to more forcefully call for lowering the year-old policy rate of 22pc. They argue that real interest rates are now above 1,000 bps on a forward-looking basis and that SBP must start reversing its stance. They also contend that rate cuts would mitigate the financial ‘stress’ on corporate borrowers and help slash our burgeoning domestic debt payments. However, this argument does not take into account the more compelling realities that favour the continuation of a tighter policy stance for now.\\nFor starters, real rates stay negative on an annual basis as the average 11-month CPI inflation still remains as high as 24.52pc — down from 29.16pc a year ago though — despite a faster-than-anticipated drop in May’s inflation rates due to a high base effect, and falling food and fuel prices. Additionally, commercial banks’ non-performing loan portfolio, which is under 8pc — below its historic average — underlines that businesses are not feeling any unbearable stress on account of high inflation and record-high interest rates. Nor is there any evidence to show that the availability of cheaper money will drive up private investment in the current political-economic environment. Fears that a rate reduction will drive up imports leading to the evaporation of our meagre international reserves, thus putting pressure on the exchange rate, and increasing inflation also abound. Will the SBP bow to political pressure and cut rates, especially when inflation is projected to surpass the proposed target of 12pc for the next fiscal year because of economic stabilisation measures such as increases in the consumption tax, petroleum levy and power prices to meet the goals of the next IMF programme? We will know once the next monetary policy is announced on Monday.\\nPublished in Dawn, June 5th, 2024', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1837900/lower-inflation'}, {'title': 'Out of time', 'content': 'TODAY, on World Environment Day, we must confront a sobering truth: an alarming 40pc of the planet’s land is degraded, putting our very survival at peril. This year, the day is centred on land restoration, desertification, and drought resilience. Globally, efforts towards land restoration and combating desertification are encouraging, but the path ahead is daunting. The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030) aims to revive ecosystems worldwide. However, with droughts increasing by 29pc since 2000 and projections that, by 2050, droughts may affect over three-quarters of the world’s population, urgent action is required. For Pakistan, these challenges are particularly acute. With more than 60pc of its land classified as rangeland and a mere 4.8pc forest cover, Pakistan is highly susceptible to desertification. The consequences are dire: loss of soil fertility, reduced farm output, and severe impacts on food security and livelihoods. The Indus delta, for instance, has shrunk dramatically due to poor water management and rising salinity, exacerbating matters.\\nThe government must make the issue a top priority. First off, reforestation and afforestation initiatives, which not only enhance biodiversity but also help in carbon sequestration, are essential. The Green Pakistan Initiative and similar programmes should be expanded and rigorously monitored. In addition, sustainable farm practices must be promoted. The use of drip irrigation, adoption of drought-resistant crop varieties, and soil conservation techniques are crucial. Agroforestry and conservation agriculture can mitigate land degradation and enhance climate resilience. Moreover, with Pakistan identified by the UN as among the countries facing drought emergencies, water management needs urgent reform. Our use should be efficient and we must develop infrastructure for rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge. Policies should focus on reducing wastage in agriculture, which accounts for the bulk of water use in the country. A major component in combating desertification is community involvement. Empowering local communities with knowledge and resources to adopt sustainable practices can foster a culture of conservation. Incentives for farmers to practise soil conservation and water-saving techniques are vital. Pakistan must also strengthen its legislation to protect natural resources. Strict enforcement of laws against illegal logging, land conversion, and overgrazing is necessary to curb further degradation. We must commit to protecting our land because we are running out of time.\\nPublished in Dawn, June 5th, 2024', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1837901/out-of-time'}, {'title': 'A sobering election?', 'content': 'IT is likely to be a bittersweet victory for the BJP and its ideological cohorts in the Sangh Parivar as India finishescounting the votesfrom its massive electoral exercise.\\nWhile Narendra Modi is poised to form his third consecutive government, electoral trends at the time of writing indicate that the BJP and its allies will be nowhere near translating their boastful claims of winning 400 seats in the Lok Sabha into reality.\\n\\nThe projections predict a simple, albeit thin, majority for the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. TheINDIA grouping, led by Congress, has made surprising gains, with a likely tally of around 200 seats. It should be remembered that in 2019, Congress was walloped; in fact, India’s grand old party has spent the last decade in the political wilderness, as the BJPplayed upthe Hindutva card, tearing apart the political structure built by Nehru and Gandhi. But the latest results indicate that things may be changing.\\nFor the BJP, Muslim-baiting and communal rhetoric appear to have backfired, even in its political heartland or ‘Hindi belt’. Instead of praising the glory of a new Hindu rashtra, Indian voters were more concerned about pressing issues, such as jobs and the cost of living.\\nThe Ram Mandir,inauguratedby Mr Modi in January, may have been a grand spectacle, but tens of millions of voters were clearly not swayed by this dangerous mixing of politics, mythology and communalism. Mr Modi’s hounding of India’s Muslims — theanti-Muslim rhetoricwas particularly pronounced during the poll campaign — has failed to translate into electoral dividends for the Sangh this time around.\\n\\nIt is hoped that the sobering election results lead to a dialling down of the inflammatory rhetoric against Muslims, and that the toxic communalism that has been promoted in India for political gains over the last decade is discarded.\\nComing to relations with Pakistan, from 2019 onwards, bilateral ties have been at their lowest in decades under Mr Modi’s watch. India’s unilateral decision toannex held Kashmirhas perhaps been the biggest obstacle standing in the way of better ties. Moreover, Mr Modi and his ministers have also used provocative languageaimed at Pakistan, including during the election campaign, which has hardly served the cause of peace.\\n\\nOnce the dust settles in Delhi and the BJP forms the next government, we hope that Narendra Modi reviews his foreign policy. India should reach out to Pakistan, and the state should respond positively to any Indian overtures. Naturally, rebuilding trust will take time, but long-term peace in South Asia is impossible without better Pakistan-India ties.\\nIndia cannot skirt around the Kashmir question; both sides should at least start talking, even if they agree to disagree. Let India’s incoming government start afresh with Pakistan.\\nPublished in Dawn, June 5th, 2024', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1837902/a-sobering-election'}, {'title': 'Real powers', 'content': 'THOUGH former president Arif Alvi seems eager to rebuild the bridges his party has burnt, he has been discovering that, in present circumstances, getting the ‘real power’ to the negotiating table can be like pulling teeth.\\nOn Tuesday, in a talk with the media in Lahore, Dr Alvi, while delving into a long metaphor about guards, gardeners and renting houses, repeated that his party would only talk to “the owner of the house”, before qualifying that with: “if the guard has decided to be the owner, he can say so, and we can talk”.\\n\\nThough Dr Alvi conceded that he has had little success in getting the PTI and establishment to negotiatedespite tryingfor the last two years, he remained hopeful about breaking the ice. “If there were no chances of success, I would have stopped trying long ago,” he explained in response to a question.\\nDr Alvi need not be so circumspect about Pakistan’s problems as he sees them. Speaking in riddles is best left to mid-tier politicians; Dr Alvi has served as the country’slongest-servingdemocratically elected president and, as such, is entitled to speak his mind without having to worry about whom he may be upsetting.\\nSimilarly, by virtue of having been supreme commander of Pakistan’s armed forces, it seems unbecoming of him to be chasing after those he wrongly considers the “owners of the house” and the “empowered”. Instead, he should be reaching out to other representatives of the people, the true owners of Pakistan.\\nEarlier this week, Dr Alvi explained that the PTI hasthree demands— supremacy of law, the release of PTI’s founder chairman Imran Khan, and the return of the party’s mandate.\\n\\nThere is no reason why these cannot be discussed with the other political parties, which, regardless of what their respective numerical strengths should be in the assemblies, still do represent the part of the citizenry that does not vote for the PTI. Indeed, the PTI seems to berepeatingone of the biggest mistakes it made during its last tenure, when it sought to sideline its rivals while seeking a direct line with the establishment.\\nOnce again, the PTI is not representative of the entirety of the people of Pakistan: even if the PTI believes the current government has been formed with rigged results, it still does not mean that its rivals got no votes at all.\\nIf for nothing else, it must respect the other elected political parties in consideration of this fact. Unless it respects the choices of those who did not and do not vote for it, and unless it engages with the representatives elected by these people, the nation will not break free of the vicious cycle of stop-start democracy it is currently caught in.\\nPublished in Dawn, June 6th, 2024', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1838113/real-powers'}, {'title': 'Airline safety', 'content': 'WHILE the European Union has yet to issue a formal statement in this regard, it seems that Pakistan has remained unable to satisfy the EU Air Safety Committee regarding the latter’s concerns pertaining to airline safety measures. As a consequence, local airlines will remain restricted from flying to the region. It may be recalled that, in March, Pakistan’s Civil Aviation Authority had expressed the hope that PIA would soon be able to resume flights to the UK once the EU Air Safety Committee completed its review in May. The CAA had been confident that it would pass the scrutiny and that the airline would be allowed to resume flights to Europe, which have remained suspended for four years since the PTI aviation minister, Ghulam Sarwar Khan, made a shocking statement about airline pilots possessing ‘dubious’ licences. The former minister’s remarks had drawn condemnation, but while he was roundly criticised for ‘exaggerating’ the figures and ‘misrepresenting’ the reality of the situation, successive governments since then have remained unable to convince the EU authorities otherwise.\\nIt is, more than anything, the loss of Pakistani travellers that they remain unable to avail the facility of flying directly to Europe on a local airline. The connecting flights they are right now forced to take due to the ban result in an additional burden in terms of the extra money and time they have to expend in order to make it to their destinations. It is the CAA’s responsibility to allay the concerns that have been raised regarding its staffing issues and adherence to safety protocols. And while it appears that it is making a sincere effort to meet expectations, it is falling short. The government must take measures to provide it with the necessary resources to ensure that the Pakistani aviation sector is operating in compliance with European safety standards. PIA has been anxious to take off: for example, the CEO of the national flag carrier had been hopeful of resuming biweekly flights to Paris in June or July. However, because the CAA seemingly fell slightly short, those plans will now have to wait. The Authority is more than capable: it is staffed with able professionals who know what they must do. It just needs to make a final, concerted push and clear the finishing line.\\nPublished in Dawn, June 6th, 2024', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1838112/airline-safety'}, {'title': 'Violent crime wave', 'content': 'THE violent crime wave that has been afflicting Karachi for the past few years shows no sign of abating, as lives full of potential are snuffed out by criminals over a mobile phone or a few thousand rupees.

Moreover, no part of Karachi seems to be immune from this crime wave. From the so-called posh areas to sprawling shantytowns, all of Karachi’s neighbourhoods are susceptible to violent crime. For example, over the past few days, armed criminals murdered an industrialist in DHA who had just drawn cash from a bank, while in Korangi, a used-shoe vendor met the same fate. The numbers paint a tragic picture. Figures published by this paper show that up till mid-April, 60 people had lost their lives in street crime incidents. The total number of victims in 2023 was 108.\\nThe state’s reaction to this crime epidemic has been inadequate. The latest step the Sindh government has taken is to ban the display of arms for three months. If this is linked to street crime, it is unlikely to stem the tide. Moreover, private guards working for state functionaries and ruling party apparatchiks openly brandish their weapons. Rather than instilling fear in the criminals, these vulgar displays of power frighten law-abiding citizens. The MQM has suggested issuing more arms licences to Karachi’s citizens. But in a city awash with arms — many of them illegal — will more guns solve the problem? When the state fails to act, a jittery public takes the law into its own hands by lynching suspects. De-weaponisation and professional policing are key to cracking down on violent crime. Does the Sindh government have the wherewithal to do the needful?\\nPublished in Dawn, June 6th, 2024', 'url': 'https://www.dawn.com/news/1838111/violent-crime-wave'}]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mHere are the URLs for the articles published in Dawn newspaper between June 4th and June 6th, 2024:\n",
